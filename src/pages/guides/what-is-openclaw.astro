      <h2>The Short Version</h2>
      <p>OpenClaw is a free, open-source AI assistant that <strong>actually does things</strong> for you. You message it from WhatsApp, and it handles tasks like checking your email, managing your calendar, booking restaurants, and setting reminders.</p>

      <p>Unlike ChatGPT or Siri, OpenClaw connects to your real apps and takes real actions. It doesn't just answer questions — it does the work.</p>

      <h2>How is it Different from ChatGPT?</h2>
      <p>Think of it this way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> answers your questions. "What's a good Italian restaurant near me?" — it gives you suggestions.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenClaw</strong> does the task. "Book me a table for 2 at an Italian place on Friday at 7pm" — it actually makes the booking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OpenClaw is more like a personal assistant than a chatbot. It connects to your email, calendar, and other services to take action on your behalf.</p>

      <h2>What Can It Do?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> Check your inbox, flag urgent messages, draft replies</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar:</strong> Schedule meetings, set reminders, check your availability</li>
        <li><strong>Bookings:</strong> Reserve restaurants, order taxis, make appointments</li>
        <li><strong>Research:</strong> Look things up, summarise articles, compare options</li>
        <li><strong>Reminders:</strong> Set alerts for tasks, follow-ups, and deadlines</li>
        <li><strong>Custom tasks:</strong> Anything you can teach it through "skills"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is My Data Safe?</h2>
      <p>Yes. OpenClaw runs on <strong>your own server</strong> (or your own computer). Your messages, emails, and calendar data never pass through anyone else's systems. You're in full control.</p>
      <p>It's open source, so the code is public and auditable. There's no company collecting your data or locking you in.</p>

      <h2>What Does It Cost?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenClaw itself:</strong> Free (open source)</li>
        <li><strong>AI brain (Anthropic API):</strong> £2–10/month depending on use</li>
        <li><strong>Hosting (optional):</strong> £5/month on Railway, or free on your own computer</li>
        <li><strong>Total:</strong> £2–15/month for your own AI assistant</li>
      </ul>
