      </div>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>OpenClaw uses the WhatsApp Web protocol to connect to your phone. You scan a QR code (just like setting up WhatsApp on a computer), and your assistant appears as a contact you can message.</p>
      <p>It's not a separate app — you use your normal WhatsApp. The assistant shows up like any other chat.</p>

      <h2>Quick Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Start OpenClaw</strong> — make sure it's running (via Railway or locally)</li>
        <li><strong>Open the control panel</strong> — go to your OpenClaw dashboard in a web browser</li>
        <li><strong>Scan the QR code</strong> — open WhatsApp on your phone, go to Linked Devices, and scan</li>
        <li><strong>Send a test message</strong> — type "hello" and check you get a response</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>OpenClaw already set up and running (<a href="/guides/railway-quick-start">set it up here</a> if you haven't)</li>
        <li>WhatsApp installed on your phone</li>
        <li>A web browser to access the OpenClaw dashboard</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
      <h3>QR code won't scan</h3>
      <p>Make sure your phone camera is clean and well-lit. Try refreshing the dashboard page to generate a new QR code. The code expires after about 60 seconds.</p>

      <h3>Messages not getting through</h3>
      <p>Check that OpenClaw is still running (the dashboard should show "Online"). If you're on Railway, check the deployment logs for errors.</p>

      <h3>Connection drops</h3>
      <p>WhatsApp occasionally disconnects linked devices. If this happens, re-scan the QR code. This is a known limitation of the WhatsApp Web protocol.</p>

        <h3>Not Set Up Yet?</h3>
        <p>You need OpenClaw running before you can connect WhatsApp. Start with the easy guide.</p>
