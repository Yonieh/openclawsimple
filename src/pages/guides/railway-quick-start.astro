      <h2>Why Railway?</h2>
      <p>Railway is a hosting platform that handles all the technical stuff for you. You don't need to know what Linux is, what a terminal is, or how servers work. You click a button and it just works.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>One-click deploy</strong> - Literally click one button</li>
        <li><strong>£5/month</strong> - Cheaper than Netflix</li>
        <li><strong>24/7 online</strong> - Your PC doesn't need to stay on</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic updates</strong> - New OpenClaw features deploy automatically</li>
        <li><strong>Zero maintenance</strong> - Set it and forget it</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step 1: Get an Anthropic API Key</h2>
      <p>OpenClaw uses Claude (made by Anthropic) as its brain. You need an API key to let it think.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://console.anthropic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: var(--accent);">console.anthropic.com</a></li>
        <li>Sign up for an account (free)</li>
        <li>Add £5-10 credit to your account (pay-as-you-go, lasts weeks for normal use)</li>
        <li>Click "API Keys" in the sidebar</li>
        <li>Click "Create Key" and copy it somewhere safe</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Expect to spend £2-5/month on API usage for personal use. Heavy users might spend £10-15.</p>

      <h2>Step 2: Deploy to Railway</h2>
      <p>Now the fun part. Click this button:</p>

      <div class="cta-box">
        <a href="https://railway.app/new/template/openclaw" class="cta-btn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          🚀 Deploy to Railway
        </a>
      </div>

      <p>You'll be asked to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Sign up for Railway</strong> - Use GitHub login (easiest)</li>
        <li><strong>Paste your Anthropic API key</strong> - The one from Step 1</li>
        <li><strong>Click Deploy</strong> - That's it</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Railway will build and deploy OpenClaw. This takes about 2-3 minutes. You'll see a progress bar.</p>

      <h2>Step 3: Connect WhatsApp</h2>
      <p>Once deployed, you need to connect your WhatsApp so you can message your assistant.</p>

      <p><strong>We'll add detailed WhatsApp setup instructions here soon.</strong> For now, check the <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: var(--accent);">official OpenClaw docs</a>.</p>

      <h2>Step 4: Start Using It</h2>
      <p>Message your OpenClaw assistant on WhatsApp and try:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Check my emails and flag anything urgent"</li>
        <li>"What's on my calendar this week?"</li>
        <li>"Remind me to call Dave at 2pm tomorrow"</li>
        <li>"Book me a table for 2 on Friday at 7pm"</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pricing Breakdown</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Railway hosting:</strong> £5/month (24/7 server)</li>
        <li><strong>Anthropic API:</strong> £2-10/month (depends on usage)</li>
        <li><strong>Total:</strong> £7-15/month for a personal AI assistant</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Compare that to hiring a virtual assistant (£500+/month) or wasting 5 hours a week on admin tasks (your time = priceless).</p>

      <div class="cta-box">
